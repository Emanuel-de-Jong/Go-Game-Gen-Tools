CODE QUALITY/BUGS
    - use events (instead of calling stats update funcs in custom, have stats listen to events and update itself)
    - name listeners to what they do instead of what event they listen to
    - fix seeing stone after tree jump and cross
    - fix tree jump besogo maximum call stack size exceeded
    - fix tree jump > click > tree jump before analyze result
    - fix tree jump using wrong cross
        use besogo click event instead of cross coord
    - refactor
