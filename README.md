# Go Game Gen Tools
This repository and the core codebase is the predecessor of [Gosuji](https://github.com/Emanuel-de-Jong/Gosuji). But due to its customization capabilities and ease of running standalone, I used it multiple times to generate `sgf` files for personal data analysis.

The base code can be found in `GoTrainer-HumanAI`. The slight modifications for analysis can be found in the other directories. You can find the results of these analyses in some of the releases.

**Active Development:** 2022-07-09 - 2022-12-20<br>
**Last Change:** 2025-08-11<br>
