# Go Game Gen Tools

This repository and the core codebase is the predecessor of [Gosuji](https://github.com/Emanuel-de-Jong/Gosuji). But due to its customization capabilities and ease of running standalone, I used it multiple times to generate `sgf` files for personal data analysis. The slight modifications for them can be found in the various git branches.
